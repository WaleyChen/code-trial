== My Personal Rails 3 Boilerplate with HAML, Mongoid, and Twitter Bootstrap

This is essentially a default Rails 3 app with some extras added off the bat. The Gemfile
has been changed to use HAML, Mongoid, as well as Twitter Bootstrap.  I have also run the installation
commands for Mongoid and Bootstrap.  

I prefer Mongoid and HAML to the Rails defaults, so this is an example of how to integrate these tools from
a blank Rails 3 app.  From here, it's just a little easier to make beautiful, powerful Rails apps.
